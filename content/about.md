Welcome to the "Data Analysis with R" workshop website! I am delighted to have received an invitation from the Staff Development Centre, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura to present this workshop.

Data analysis is a crucial component of research in many fields, including health sciences. It involves the process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract insights and make informed decisions. R is a powerful programming language and software environment that is widely used for data analysis and visualization in various fields, including health sciences.

This workshop is designed for individuals who are new to R and data analysis, or for those who are looking to refresh their skills. Over the course of this workshop, we will cover the basics of R, including data types, functions, and data structures. We will also introduce various data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, and statistical modeling.

This website is the home for materials related to the workshop, including lecture notes, practice exercises, and data sets. I encourage participants to use these materials to follow along with the workshop and to practice their skills independently.

I hope that this workshop will be a valuable learning experience for all participants and that it will provide a foundation for further exploration of data analysis with R.
